## Cloning

we can clone in three ways:https, SSH, GIThub CLI

Since we are using GitHub codespace, we'll create a temporary directory in our work space
```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp/new-project
git init
touch readme.md
code Readme.md
```
## Make changes to readme.md
```
git commit -a -m "add readme file"

# If any changes 
git rest
```

## HTTPS


```sh 
cd GithubExample
```

```
## SSH

```
