## Cloning
### clone
We are using git Hub
we can clone in three ways:https, SSH, GIThub CLI

Since we are using GitHub codespace, we'll create a temporary directory in our work space
```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp/new-project
git init
touch readme.md
code Readme.md
```
## Make changes to readme.md
```
git commit -a -m "add readme file"

# If any changes 
git rest
```

## HTTPS

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/atulgosain/GithubExample.git
cd GithubExample
```

Adding a line to confirm the push with PR and new branch 8

>You will need to generated a personal Access token (PAT)
https://github.com/settings/token

You will use PAT as your password when you login

-Give it access to contents for Commits

## SSH

```
need to add ssh details for clone and commit
git@github.com:atulgosain/GithubExample.git
cd GithubExample

```
We will create our own ssh rsa key pair
cat /home/atulgosain/.ssh/alt-github_id_rsa.pub

## Manage SSH key:
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_atul

ssh-add:
A command to add private SSH keys to the SSH authentication agent (ssh-agent). The SSH agent caches your key so you don't need to repeatedly enter your passphrase when accessing SSH servers (like GitHub).

~/.ssh/github_atul:
This specifies the private SSH key file you are adding.github_atul is the name of your private key file stored in the ~/.ssh/ directory.


```

## CLI Branch

gh repo clone atulgosain/GithubExample

```
git branch : to get all the branches
